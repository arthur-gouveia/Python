# Python
After a few years working with data analysis using RapidMiner and Knime I started a post graduation course on Data Science and decided to use Python as my primary data analysis language.
All code I produce while working to learn Python wil be commited here!

So, this is it. This is my Python repo to save the code I produce while learning the language.
